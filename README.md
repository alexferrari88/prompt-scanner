# prompt-scanner üîé

**Find LLM prompts in any codebase. No more hunting for the AI‚Äôs ‚Äúneedle in the haystack.‚Äù**

---

`prompt-scanner` is a blazing-fast‚Ñ¢, language-aware CLI tool that **automatically finds Large Language Model (LLM) prompts**‚Äîthe actual natural language instructions‚Äîin codebases and config files. If you‚Äôre tired of digging through endless files and wrappers just to see what prompt your AI/LLM code is using, this tool is for you.

---

## Why Use prompt-scanner?

Most modern AI wrappers and frameworks hide the real LLM prompt deep in variables, templates, or config files. Searching for them manually is tedious and error-prone. `prompt-scanner` saves you hours by **recursively scanning your project and surfacing potential prompts instantly**‚Äîno matter how buried they are.

---

## Key Features

* **Comprehensive Project Scanning:** Searches through code and configuration files in multiple languages and formats (Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, JSON, YAML, TOML, `.env`).
* **Heuristic Detection:** Intelligent filters exclude irrelevant log messages and errors, identifying genuine prompts efficiently.
* **Native Multi-language Support:** Leverages Go's AST and Tree-sitter for accurate parsing and analysis.
* **GitHub Integration:** Directly scan GitHub repositories‚Äîsimply provide the URL and `prompt-scanner` does the rest.
* **Flexible Output:** Offers tabular or JSON-formatted outputs, with optional inclusion of file paths and line numbers.
* **Highly Configurable:** Customize keywords, placeholder patterns, prompt length thresholds, and detection sensitivity.
* **Performance Optimized:** Utilizes multi-threading and skips unnecessary directories (e.g., dependencies/build folders).

## Quickstart

### Installation

```sh
go install github.com/alexferrari88/prompt-scanner@latest
```

### Basic Usage

```sh
prompt-scanner ./my-project
# or scan directly from GitHub
prompt-scanner https://github.com/user/repo
```

### Common Options

* `--json` ‚Äì Output results in JSON format.
* `--scan-configs` ‚Äì Include configuration files (JSON, YAML, TOML, `.env`).
* `--min-len=N` ‚Äì Set minimum string length to qualify as a prompt (default: 30).
* `--var-keywords=...` ‚Äì Define keywords for detecting prompt variables.
* `--content-keywords=...` ‚Äì Specify keywords that must be present in the content.
* `--greedy` ‚Äì Enable aggressive detection heuristics.

#### Example

```sh
prompt-scanner --json --scan-configs --greedy ./llm-project
```

## Sample Output

### Standard View

```

```

### JSON View

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "handlers/llm.py",
    "line": 11,
    "content": "Your task is to summarize the following article for a 12-year-old..."
  }
]
```

## Advanced Usage

* **Include Config Files:**

  ```sh
  prompt-scanner --scan-configs ./my-project
  ```

* **Direct Scanning From a Github URL:**

  ```sh
  prompt-scanner https://github.com/user/repo
  ```

* **Customize Output:**

  ```sh
  prompt-scanner --no-filepath --no-linenumber ./my-project
  ```

* **Adjust Detection Heuristics:**

  ```sh
  prompt-scanner --var-keywords=prompt,message --content-keywords=task,instruct ./my-project
  ```

### View All Options

```sh
prompt-scanner --help
```

## How It Works

* **Intelligent Parsing:** Utilizes Go's AST and Tree-sitter for precise, language-aware analysis.
* **Variable Detection:** Targets typical prompt-related variables like `prompt`, `template`, and more.
* **Smart Filtering:** Avoids false positives by excluding common non-prompt strings unless in greedy mode.
* **Supports Complex Prompts:** Handles multi-line strings and templated content effectively.
